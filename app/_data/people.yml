An MRE is a modular application framework that can be extended with plugins to create a new tool. InSilico is the working proof-of-principle implementation of such an MRE and was developed alongside this work. The created infrastructure of InSilico can be used to create, share and reuse custom research tools with less effort, time, and resources compared to the traditional approach.'
