  Jan contributes to an online database for running reproducible simulation experiments in computational biology,
   i.e. <a href="https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/tellurium-web">tellurium-web</a>.
   <br />
  Jan developed an influenza sub-classification platform based on peptides using data science and
   machine learning approaches. Part of the work was the development of the
   data management system required for bioinformatics analysis of peptide-virus binding data <a href="https://www.flutype.de/about/">FluTypeDB</a>.'

  description: '<img src="../img/projects/insilico_logo.png" title="InSilico" height="80" align="left"/> Within his thesis the concept of an Modular Research Environment (MRE) was developed. An MRE is a modular application framework that can be extended with plugins to create a new tool. InSilico is the working proof-of-principle implementation of such an MRE and was developed alongside this work. The created infrastructure of InSilico can be used to create, share and reuse custom research tools with less effort, time, and resources compared to the traditional approach.'

This library is based on the JSBML project and can be used on every operating system for which a Java Virtual Machine is available. Within this project SBSCL was extended among others with better support for SED-ML and COMBINE archives.
