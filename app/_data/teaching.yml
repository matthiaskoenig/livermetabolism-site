  Understanding a drugs pharmacokinetics - how it is absorbed, distributed, metabolised and excreted by the body - and its pharmacodynamics - how it affects the body - is a key challenge in treating people. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics are two classes of drugs used to treat high blood pressure. Both are among the most commonly prescribed drugs due to the high prevalence of hypertension in an ageing society. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In this X-student research group we will develop physiologically based pharmacokinetic models of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide and the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. The methodological approach is a combination of lectures, tutorials and practical work by the students. The research project is aimed at students with a STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) background, including biology, computer science and medical students. Basic programming skills in Python are required.

  A key challenge in treating people is to understand the pharmacokinetics of a given drug, i.e., how it is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and eliminated by the body, and the pharmacodynamics of the drug, i.e., how the substance is affecting the body. Physiological-based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) models are computational models which allow the study of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs in silico. Within this X-Student Research Group we will develop together with the students PBPK models of ACE inhibitors. The methodical approach is a combination of lectures, tutorials, and practical work by the students. The research project is aimed at a maximum of 15 students primarily for students with STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) background including biological, informatic and medical students. Basic programming skills in Python are required.

  <h4>X-Student Research Groups</h4>
  <p>
  With the X-Student Research Groups, the Berlin University Alliance supports research teams consisting of young researchers and students. The goal is to involve students in current research projects of the alliance partners and to enable them to participate in (cutting-edge) research already during their studies.
  </p>
  <p>The X-Student Research Groups are implemented in the form of research seminars and usually run for one semester. In this way, young academics have the opportunity to bring their own research into the classroom and to gain initial experience in leading research groups.</p>
  <p>The Berlin University Alliance supports up to 32 X-Student Research Groups per year.</p>
