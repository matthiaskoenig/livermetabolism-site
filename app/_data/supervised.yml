  description: 'Jan works on the stratification and personalization of computational models. He develops methods and
  software for semi-automatic data curation of pharmacokinetics information and a pharmacokinetics database for
  the storage and FAIR access of such data.
  <br />
  Jan contributes to an online database for running reproducible simulation experiments in computational biology,
   i.e. <a href="https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/tellurium-web">tellurium-web</a>.
   <br />
  Jan developed an influenza sub-classification platform based on peptides using data science and
   machine learning approaches. Part of the work was the development of the
   data management system required for bioinformatics analysis of peptide-virus binding data <a href="https://www.flutype.de/about/">FluTypeDB</a>.'
