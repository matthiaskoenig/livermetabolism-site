  abstract: "Digital twins are transforming systems medicine by enabling personalized treatment and decision support through the integration of patient-specific data with predictive computational models. The impact of digital twins in clinical and translational settings relies fundamentally on the reproducibility, transparency, and reusability of the underlying models and workflows.
  In this talk, we present our approach to developing reproducible digital twins for pharmacokinetics (PK), with a focus on understanding the effect of disease on drug disposition. Our physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models integrate curated clinical data and capture interindividual variability in physiology and metabolism. This allows us to simulate how conditions such as liver and kidney impairment alter drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.
  A key component of our framework is an open pharmacokinetics database containing structured, high-quality data from diverse clinical studies. These data support the development of individualized PBPK models that account for genetic variability, drug-drug interactions, lifestyle factors, and clinical measures such as liver function tests [10.1093/nar/gkaa990, 10.3389/fphar.2021.752826].
  The models are encoded using community standards like the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) [10.15252/msb.20199110] and are built hierarchically to reflect organ-level physiology within a whole-body context. We use a suite of open-source tools—sbml4humans, sbmlutils, cy3sbml, and FAIR indicators—to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and model reuse across research and clinical settings.
  We will showcase applications of digital twins in simulating drug responses in patients with altered hepatic function, using SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists as concrete examples. These antidiabetic drug classes are particularly affected by changes in liver and kidney function, and our models demonstrate how patient-specific parameters, including liver function test results, can be integrated into predictive simulations. This talk highlights how disease-aware digital twins can deliver mechanistic insights into pharmacokinetics and support personalized decision-making in precision medicine [10.3389/fphys.2021.730418, 10.3389/fphys.2021.757293, 10.3389/fphar.2022.1029073].

Here, we present our work on PBPK models for metabolic phenotyping and liver function evaluation [1-5]. To develop and validate our models, we established the first open pharmacokinetics database, PK-DB, which contains curated data from over 600 clinical studies. Our models can be individualized and stratified, allowing us to simulate the effect of lifestyle factors and co-administration on drug metabolism.
   We have applied our models to various clinical questions, such as simulating individual outcomes after hepatectomy using an indocyanine green model and studying the effect of CYP2D6 gene variants using a model of dextromethorphan coupled with drug-gene interactions. These models are constructed hierarchically, describing metabolism and other biological processes of organs such as liver and kidney coupled to whole-body physiology. All models and data are available for reuse in a reproducible manner encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).
   One of the major challenges in PBPK modeling is the integration of these models with cellular and continuum-biomechanical models. By coupling PBPK models with these models, it becomes possible to provide drug concentrations at the site of action as boundary conditions and time-varying inputs to continuum-biomechanical models. This approach enables us to study the impact of systemic chemotherapy on tumor growth or to investigate changes in perfusion and pressure at the whole-body level on transport and biomechanical properties at the tissue scale.
   To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we present an example of PBPK modeling coupled with a multiscale and multiphase continuum-biomechanical model for the liver. Our model integrates partial differential equations (PDE) on the lobular scale with ordinary differential equations (ODE) on the cellular and whole-body scale, resulting in a PDE-ODE coupling. In our showcase, we investigate the drug metabolization process in the liver, considering the possible damage to the liver tissue due to necrosis caused by a toxic side product. The substrates and products of this process can be transported via the systemic circulation and be removed by the kidneys. By coupling PBPK models with continuum-biomechanical models, we can study the transport and biomechanical properties of these substances at both the tissue and whole-body levels. This coupling approach provides a promising method for studying drug metabolism and its effect on the human body at multiple scales, ranging from cellular to whole-body.
   Our approach allows us to investigate the impact of this drug metabolization process on the liver tissue and how it affects the overall functioning of the body. Additionally, we can study the impact of various factors, such as different drug dosages, on this process and determine the optimal drug dosage for a given patient. This integrated approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the drug metabolization process and its impact on the human body, paving the way for more effective drug development and personalized medicine.

In this study, we present a modeling workflow tailored to these critical aspects, with a focus on liver function tests.
  Evaluating liver function is a crucial task in hepatology, yet accurately quantifying hepatic function has persisted as a clinical challenge. Dynamic liver function tests offer a promising method for non-invasive in vivo assessment of liver function and metabolic phenotyping. These clinical tests determine liver function through the elimination of a specific test substance, thus revealing information about the liver's metabolic capacity.
  We employed whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to simulate these tests, which encompass absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination processes. PBPK models serve as powerful instruments for investigating drug metabolism and its impact on the human body. In this research, we showcase our efforts in utilizing PBPK models as digital twins for metabolic phenotyping and liver function evaluation [1-6]. To develop and validate our models, we created the first open pharmacokinetics database, PK-DB, containing curated data from over 600 clinical studies. Our models are individualizable and stratifiable, enabling simulation of lifestyle factors and co-administration effects on drug metabolism.
  We have applied our models to various clinical inquiries, such as simulating individual outcomes post-hepatectomy using an indocyanine green model and examining the influence of CYP2D6 gene variants through a dextromethorphan model integrated with drug-gene interactions. These models are constructed hierarchically, describing metabolic and other biological processes in organs like the liver and kidneys, connected to whole-body physiology. All models and data are accessible for reuse in a reproducible manner, encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).
  In this study, we provide an overview of PBPK models and demonstrate how SBML [7-8], COMBINE standards [9], and FAIR principles [10] can facilitate model development, coupling, and reuse.

  abstract: "Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are powerful tools for studying drug metabolism and its effect on the human body. Here, we present our work on applying PBPK models as digital twins for metabolic phenotyping and liver function evaluation [1-6]. To develop and validate our models, we established the first open pharmacokinetics database, PK-DB, which contains curated data from over 600 clinical studies. Our models can be individualized and stratified, allowing us to simulate the effect of lifestyle factors and co-administration on drug metabolism.
