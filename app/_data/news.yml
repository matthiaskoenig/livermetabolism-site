  short: "In this bachelor thesis, a PBPK/PD model of dapagliflozin was developed to investigate how physiological and external factors such as hepatorenal impairment and food intake influence drug behavior and therapeutic efficacy in type 2 diabetes treatment."
  abstract: "Dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor for type 2 diabetes, reduces plasma glucose levels by enhancing urinary glucose excretion (UGE). However, its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are subject to considerable interindividual variability influenced by dosing, organ function, and food intake. This study presents a physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) model, constructed using SBML and data from 27 clinical trials, with modular representations of intestinal absorption, hepatic metabolism, and renal excretion.  
  The model reliably reproduces observed dose-dependent PK/PD profiles and simulates physiological variability and food effects. Simulations reveal that renal impairment markedly reduces UGE, while hepatic impairment has a minor impact. Food intake significantly lowers peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) without affecting AUC, highlighting a clinically relevant effect on pharmacodynamics often overlooked.  
  This work provides mechanistic insight into key determinants of dapagliflozin variability and supports its use in predictive modeling for individualized therapy in diabetes care."

  abstract: "Guidelines for managing scientific data have been established under the FAIR principles requiring that data be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. In many scientific disciplines, especially computational biology, both data and models are key to progress. For this reason, and recognizing that such models are a very special type of 'data', we argue that computational models, especially mechanistic models prevalent in medicine, physiology and systems biology, deserve a complementary set of guidelines. We propose the CURE principles, emphasizing that models should be Credible, Understandable, Reproducible, and Extensible. We delve into each principle, discussing verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification for model credibility; the clarity of model descriptions and annotations for understandability; adherence to standards and open science practices for reproducibility; and the use of open standards and modular code for extensibility and reuse. We outline recommended and baseline requirements for each aspect of CURE, aiming to enhance the impact and trustworthiness of computational models, particularly in biomedical applications where credibility is paramount. Our perspective underscores the need for a more disciplined approach to modeling, aligning with emerging trends such as Digital Twins and emphasizing the importance of data and modeling standards for interoperability and reuse. Finally, we emphasize that given the non-trivial effort required to implement the guidelines, the community moves to automate as many of the guidelines as possible."

  abstract: "We are pleased to announce that Elisabetta Cassabianca will be joining the König Lab to work on an exciting new project focused on developing a physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) model of the direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) rivaroxaban.
  
  Since their introduction, DOACs have revolutionized anticoagulant therapy, offering significant advantages over traditional vitamin K antagonist therapy, such as reduced dietary restrictions and less frequent monitoring. However, despite their widespread adoption, there remain gaps in understanding their long-term efficacy, safety, and impact on specific patient populations.
  
  Elisabetta’s project aims to address these knowledge gaps by constructing a comprehensive PBPK/PD model of rivaroxaban. This computational model will serve as a digital twin of the human body, enabling precise predictions of the drug’s pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and pharmacodynamics (anticoagulant effects). The model will be instrumental in exploring the influence of various factors, such as age, gender, hepatic or renal impairment, and genetic variations, on rivaroxaban therapy."

  short: "Jonas Küttner submitted his Master thesis developing a workflow for image analysis in the liver"
  abstract: "The mammalian liver is organized into three-dimensional structures called lobules that are integral to its function. According to the widely accepted hexagonal model, the cross-section of each lobule is characterized by a central vein and portal triads at the corners. These portal triads consist of a hepatic portal vein, a hepatic arteriole, and a bile duct. Blood is delivered through the hepatic artery and portal vein and flows inward from the outer periportal region toward the central vein through sinusoids lined with hepatocytes. These hepatocytes express a wide variety of metabolic enzymes, including cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms that are critical for xenobiotic metabolism. Notably, many hepatic enzymes, including CYPs, exhibit differential expression along the periportal-to-perivenous axis, a spatial variation known as liver zonation.
  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver diseases characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver (steatosis) in the absence of significant alcohol consumption. Histopathologically, NAFLD is characterized by the presence of microvesicular fat droplets within hepatocytes.
  Although liver zonation has been extensively studied, the protein gradients of CYPs and their alterations in response to steatosis have not been systematically quantified or compared across species. This study aimed to develop an image analysis workflow to accurately derive these lobular expression gradients and quantify macrosteatosis in whole slide images (WSI) of liver histology.
  A comprehensive analysis was performed on whole slide images (WSIs) of mouse, rat, pig, and human liver specimens. These images included hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides and immunohistochemically stained slides for glutamine synthetase (GS) and cytochrome P450 isoforms 1A2, 2E1, 2D6, and 3A4. To achieve the study objectives, two image analysis workflows were developed: one using classical methods and the other using convolutional neural networks (CNN). These workflows were designed to perform two key tasks: (1) segmentation of liver lobules and (2) detection of macrosteatosis droplets.
  Key findings were that there was significant variability in lobular geometry within subjects, with strong consistency across species, with inter-species differences observed primarily in lobular size. A slight increase in lobular size was observed in steatotic samples, with a moderate to strong correlation between lobular size and steatosis content. In addition, interspecies differences in zonation patterns were observed for CYP1A2 in pigs, CYP2E1 in rats, and CYP3A4 in humans. Importantly, zonation patterns in steatotic subjects were not qualitatively different from those in non-steatotic subjects across species.
  In summary, I have successfully developed and implemented an image analysis workflow for whole slide images (WSIs) that allows detailed examination of liver lobule geometry and macrosteatosis droplets. Furthermore, the resulting datasets were integrated to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the zonal distribution of CYP protein expression and macrosteatosis within the lobules."

  short: "Mariia Myshkina and Matthias König presented our captopril modeling results during the PAGE2024 (Population Approach Group Europe) meeting in Rome."
  abstract: 'Introduction: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as captopril, are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Captopril, the first ACE inhibitor developed in the 1980s, is primarily taken orally and is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations within an hour. Its half-life is approximately 2 hours, but several factors, including renal function, heart disease, age and sex, can affect its pharmacokinetics.
Despite the widespread use of captopril, comprehensive pharmacokinetic data have been lacking. Our group has developed PK-DB (https://pk-db.com) [1], an open database containing high-quality pharmacokinetic data from clinical and preclinical research. PK-DB includes patient cohort characteristics, interventions, concentration-time profiles, and kinetic parameters, with the ability to automatically calculate pharmacokinetic parameters using non-compartmental methods.
Objectives: The objectives of this study were to curate and analyze captopril pharmacokinetic data, expand the PK-DB, develop a whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) model of captopril in accordance with FAIR principles [2], and improve understanding of the intra-individual variability in captopril pharmacokinetics influenced by factors such as age, sex, renal and cardiac function.
Methods: Over 600 publications on captopril pharmacokinetics were reviewed through a systematic literature search, with a subset selected for data curation in PK-DB. The PBPK model was developed using a compartmental approach and encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) [3] for accessibility and reproducibility.
Results: A comprehensive set of captopril pharmacokinetic data was generated from 15 clinical studies in healthy volunteers and patients with renal impairment, heart failure and hypertension. The PBPK model includes four major compartments (blood, intestine, liver, kidney) and describes absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. It successfully represents the pharmacokinetic profile of captopril in different age groups, showing minimal age-related differences in unchanged drug concentration. Heart failure did not significantly affect maximum plasma concentration or area under the curve (AUC), but renal function strongly influenced captopril elimination. We present this data set and open PBPK model of captopril as a valuable resource for further research.
Conclusions: This study successfully establishes a freely accessible, comprehensive dataset and an open PBPK model of captopril, enhancing our understanding of its pharmacokinetic behavior across different patient groups. Our findings emphasize the significance of renal function in captopril elimination and provide a valuable resource for personalized medicine approaches in hypertension and heart failure treatment.'

Enalapril works as an ACE inhibitor, playing a crucial role in regulating blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Shubhankar's research involved the creation of an extensive database from 49 clinical trials, which was used to parameterize and validate his computational model. His model effectively simulates the pharmacokinetics of enalapril and its active metabolite, enalaprilat, under various conditions including renal and hepatic impairment and changes in CES1 enzyme activity.

The findings from this study offer valuable insights into how different physiological impairments affect the drug's behavior in the body, showing excellent agreement with clinical data. The developed model and data are publicly accessible in SBML format under a CC-BY 4.0 license from the PK-DB pharmacokinetics database, contributing to open science and further research in pharmacokinetics.

  short: "We're excited to announce the preprint of our latest research, 'Simulation of zonation-function relationships in the liver using coupled multiscale models: Application to drug-induced liver injury.' This study introduces a multiscale digital twin of the liver, integrating models from cellular to lobular scales, and sheds light on how liver zonation patterns influence drug-induced liver injury."
  abstract: 'Multiscale modeling requires the coupling of models on different scales, often based on different mathematical approaches and developed by different research teams. This poses many challenges, such as defining interfaces for coupling, reproducible exchange of submodels, efficient simulation of the models, or reproducibility of results. Here, we present a multiscale digital twin of the liver that couples a partial differential equation (PDE)-based porous media approach for the hepatic lobule with cellular-scale ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based models. The models based on the theory of porous media describe transport, tissue mechanical properties, and deformations at the lobular scale, while the cellular models describe hepatic metabolism in terms of drug metabolism and damage in terms of necrosis. The resulting multiscale model of the liver was used to simulate perfusion-zonation-function relationships in the liver spanning scales from single cell to the lobulus. The model was applied to study the effects of (i) protein zonation patterns (metabolic zonation) and (ii) drug concentration dependence on spatially heterogeneous liver damage in the form of necrosis. Depending on the zonation pattern, different liver damage patterns could be reproduced, including periportal and pericentral necrosis as seen in drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Increasing the drug concentration led to an increase in the observed damage pattern. A key point for the success was the integration of domain-specific simulators based on standard exchange formats, i.e., libroadrunner for the high-performance simulation of ODE-based systems and FEBio for the simulation of the continuum-biomechanical part. This allows a standardized and reproducible exchange of cellular scale models in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) between research groups.'

Despite the paramount significance of liver function assessment in hepatology, reliable quantification remains a clinical challenge. Dynamic liver function tests offer a promising method for non-invasive in vivo assessment of liver function and metabolic phenotyping.<br /><br />
 
By leveraging whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, we're simulating these tests and positioning PBPK models as digital twins for metabolic phenotyping and liver function assessment. To develop and validate our models, we established the open pharmacokinetics database, PK-DB, containing curated data from 600+ clinical studies. Our models are individualizable and stratifiable, enabling simulation of lifestyle factors and co-administration effects on drug metabolism. Our models have been instrumental in clinical scenarios: from predicting individual outcomes post-hepatectomy to discerning the impact of CYP2D6 gene variants on liver function tests. These models are constructed hierarchically, describing metabolic and other biological processes in organs like the liver and kidneys, seamlessly integrated with whole-body physiology.<br /><br />

Notably, all models and data are readily available and reproducible for reuse, encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). We will provide an overview of these PBPK models and demonstrate how SBML and FAIR principles can facilitate model development, coupling, and reuse."

  short: 'Our latest publication is now on Frontiers of Endocrinology: A pathway model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the pancreatic β-cell'
  abstract: 'The pancreas plays a critical role in maintaining glucose homeostasis through the secretion of hormones from the islets of Langerhans. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by the pancreatic β-cell is the main mechanism for reducing elevated plasma glucose. Here we present a systematic modeling workflow for the development of kinetic pathway models using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). Steps include retrieval of information from databases, curation of experimental and clinical data for model calibration and validation, integration of heterogeneous data including absolute and relative measurements, unit normalization, data normalization, and model annotation. An important factor was the reproducibility and exchangeability of the model, which allowed the use of various existing tools. The workflow was applied to construct a novel data-driven kinetic model of GSIS in the pancreatic β-cell based on experimental and clinical data from 39 studies spanning 50 years of pancreatic, islet, and β-cell research in humans, rats, mice, and cell lines. The model consists of detailed glycolysis and phenomenological equations for insulin secretion coupled to cellular energy state, ATP dynamics and (ATP/ADP ratio). Key findings of our work are that in GSIS there is a glucose-dependent increase in almost all intermediates of glycolysis. This increase in glycolytic metabolites is accompanied by an increase in energy metabolites, especially ATP and NADH. One of the few decreasing metabolites is ADP, which, in combination with the increase in ATP, results in a large increase in ATP/ADP ratios in the β-cell with increasing glucose. Insulin secretion is dependent on ATP/ADP, resulting in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The observed glucose-dependent increase in glycolytic intermediates and the resulting change in ATP/ADP ratios and insulin secretion is a robust phenomenon observed across data sets, experimental systems and species. Model predictions of the glucose-dependent response of glycolytic intermediates and biphasic insulin secretion are in good agreement with experimental measurements. Our model predicts that factors affecting ATP consumption, ATP formation, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and ATP/ADP-dependent insulin secretion have a major effect on GSIS. In conclusion, we have developed and applied a systematic modeling workflow for pathway models that allowed us to gain insight into key mechanisms in GSIS in the pancreatic β-cell.'

  abstract: "Congratulations to Bea for successfully submitting her Bachelor thesis on a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of the probe drug talinolol for the characterization of intestinal P-glycoprotein.
    Talinolol, a cardioselective beta-blocker applied in treating various cardiovascular diseases and tachyarrhythmias, is widely adopted as a probe drug for the intestinal efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. In the human body, P-gp plays a crucial role, given its distribution across various tissues to protect against potentially toxic substances, while expediting the elimination of xenobiotics. By employing talinolol for P-gp phenotyping, researchers can evaluate factors that influence P-gp-mediated transport, such as P-gp genetic polymorphisms and its distribution throughout the intestine.

    Bea's thesis presents a comprehensive dataset on talinolol pharmacokinetics, the study of how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes drugs. This data was used to develop a PBPK model for talinolol, offering detailed insights into its behaviour within the body.

    The new model investigates the impact of numerous factors on talinolol's pharmacokinetics, including the genetic variants of P-gp, enzymatic activity of transporters OATP2B1 and OATP1B1, and site-specific distribution of P-gp and OATP2B1 proteins in the intestine. It also investigates the impact of diseases like liver cirrhosis and renal dysfunction."

In this study, we present a modeling workflow tailored to these critical aspects, with a focus on liver function tests.
Evaluating liver function is a crucial task in hepatology, yet accurately quantifying hepatic function has persisted as a clinical challenge. Dynamic liver function tests offer a promising method for non-invasive in vivo assessment of liver function and metabolic phenotyping. These clinical tests determine liver function through the elimination of a specific test substance, thus revealing information about the liver's metabolic capacity.
We employed whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to simulate these tests, which encompass absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination processes. PBPK models serve as powerful instruments for investigating drug metabolism and its impact on the human body. In this research, we showcase our efforts in utilizing PBPK models as digital twins for metabolic phenotyping and liver function evaluation. To develop and validate our models, we created the first open pharmacokinetics database, PK-DB, containing curated data from over 600 clinical studies. Our models are individualizable and stratifiable, enabling simulation of lifestyle factors and co-administration effects on drug metabolism.
We have applied our models to various clinical inquiries, such as simulating individual outcomes post-hepatectomy using an indocyanine green model and examining the influence of CYP2D6 gene variants through a dextromethorphan model integrated with drug-gene interactions. These models are constructed hierarchically, describing metabolic and other biological processes in organs like the liver and kidneys, connected to whole-body physiology. All models and data are accessible for reuse in a reproducible manner, encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).
In this study, we provide an overview of PBPK models and demonstrate how SBML, COMBINE standards, and FAIR principles can facilitate model development, coupling, and reuse."

  short: "We present 11 strategies for making  #OpenScience & #ReproducibleResearch the norm at research  institutions, with tips for implementation & resources. Let's join hands to make these practices standard in the scientific community!"
  abstract: 'Across disciplines, researchers increasingly recognize that open science and reproducible research practices may accelerate scientific progress by allowing others to reuse research outputs and by promoting rigorous research that is more likely to yield trustworthy results. While initiatives, training programs, and funder policies encourage researchers to adopt reproducible research and open science practices, these practices are uncommon in many fields. Researchers need training to integrate these practices into their daily work. We organized a virtual brainstorming event, in collaboration with the German Reproducibility Network, to discuss strategies for making reproducible research and open science training the norm at research institutions. Here, we outline eleven strategies, concentrated in three areas: (1) offering training, (2) adapting research assessment criteria and program requirements, and (3) building communities. We provide a brief overview of each strategy, offer tips for implementation, and provide links to resources. Our goal is to encourage members of the research community to think creatively about the many ways they can contribute and collaborate to build communities, and make reproducible research and open science training the norm. Researchers may act in their roles as scientists, supervisors, mentors, instructors, and members of curriculum, hiring or evaluation committees. Institutional leadership and research administration and support staff can accelerate progress by implementing change across their institutions.'

  abstract: 'We have developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for CYP2E1 phenotyping via chlorzoxazone. This model takes into account various factors that can influence the activity of CYP enzymes, such as genetics, diet, age, environmental factors, and disease, making it a highly effective and reliable tool for assessing the in vivo activity of the CYP2E1 enzyme.
  
  What is  truly exciting about this research is that it incorporates the effect of ethanol consumption and liver impairment on the results of metabolic phenotyping with chlorzoxazone. This means that the model is not only accurate but also highly practical, as it takes into account factors that are commonly encountered in clinical practice.
  
  The extensive pharmacokinetic dataset for chlorzoxazone and the validated PBPK model are expected to have a significant impact on the field of pharmacokinetics, as they provide a reliable and comprehensive tool for assessing the activity of CYP2E1 in a wide range of clinical contexts. This research represents a major step forward in our understanding of the factors that influence the activity of CYP enzymes and promises to have a significant impact on the development of new drugs and the optimization of existing ones.'

  short: 'Our latest preprint is now on bioRxiv: A consensus model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the pancreatic beta-cell'
  abstract: 'The pancreas plays a critical role in maintaining glucose homeostasis through the secretion of hormones from the islets of Langerhans. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by the pancreatic beta-cell is the main mechanism for reducing elevated plasma glucose. Here we present a systematic modeling workflow for the development of kinetic pathway models using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). The workflow was applied to construct the first consensus model of GSIS in the pancreatic beta-cell based on experimental and clinical data from 39 studies spanning 50 years of pancreatic, islet, and beta-cell research in humans, rats, mice, and cell lines. The model consists of detailed glycolysis and equations for insulin secretion coupled to cellular energy state (ATP/ADP ratio). Key findings of our work are that in GSIS there is a glucose-dependent increase in almost all intermediates of glycolysis. This increase in glycolytic metabolites is accompanied by an increase in energy metabolites, especially ATP and NADH. One of the few decreasing metabolites is ADP, which, in combination with the increase in ATP, results in a large increase in ATP/ADP ratios in the beta-cell with increasing glucose. Insulin secretion is dependent on ATP/ADP, resulting in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The observed glucose-dependent increase in glycolytic intermediates and the resulting change in ATP/ADP ratios and insulin secretion is a robust phenomenon observed across data sets, experimental systems and species.'

  Understanding a drugs pharmacokinetics - how it is absorbed, distributed, metabolised and excreted by the body - and its pharmacodynamics - how it affects the body - is a key challenge in treating people. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics are two classes of drugs used to treat high blood pressure. Both are among the most commonly prescribed drugs due to the high prevalence of hypertension in an ageing society. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In this X-student research group we will develop physiologically based pharmacokinetic models of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide and the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. The methodological approach is a combination of lectures, tutorials and practical work by the students. The research project is aimed at students with a STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) background, including biology, computer science and medical students. Basic programming skills in Python are required.

  short: 'Our latest preprint is now on medRxiv: Simvastatin therapy in different subtypes of hypercholesterolemia - a physiologically based modelling approach.'
  abstract: 'Hypercholesterolemia is a multifaceted plasma lipid disorder with heterogeneous causes including lifestyle and genetic factors. A key feature of hypercholesterolemia is elevated plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Several genetic variants have been reported to be associated with hypercholesterolemia, known as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Important variants affect the LDL receptor (LDLR), which mediates the uptake of LDL-C from the plasma, apoliporotein B (APOB), which is involved in the binding of LDL-C to the LDLR, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which modulates the degradation of the LDLR. A typical treatment for hypercholesterolemia is statin medication, with simvastatin being one of the most commonly prescribed statins. In this work, the LDL-C lowering therapy with simvastatin in hypercholesterolemia was investigated using a computational modeling approach. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of simvastatin integrated with a pharmacodynamic model of plasma LDL-C (PBPK/PD) was developed based on extensive data curation. A key component of the model is LDL-C turnover by the liver, consisting of: hepatic cholesterol synthesis with the key enzymes HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase; cholesterol export from the liver as VLDL-C; de novo synthesis of LDLR; transport of LDLR to the membrane; binding of LDL-C by LDLR via APOB; endocytosis of the LDLR-LDL-C complex; recycling of LDLR from the complex. The model was applied to study the effects of simvastatin therapy in hypercholesterolemia due to different causes in the LDLR pathway corresponding to different subtypes of hypercholesterolemia. Model predictions of LDL-C lowering therapy were validated with independent clinical data sets. Key findings are: (i) hepatic LDLR turnover is highly heterogeneous among FH classes; (ii) despite this heterogeneity, simvastatin therapy results in a consistent reduction in plasma LDL-C regardless of class; and (iii) simvastatin therapy shows a dose-dependent reduction in LDL-C. Our model suggests that the underlying cause of hypercholesterolemia does not influence simvastatin therapy. Furthermore, our model supports the treatment strategy of stepwise dose adjustment to achieve target LDL-C levels. Both the model and the database are freely available for reuse.'

  abstract: 'Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death. Diagnosis and treatment are time-critical and require highly patient-specific diagnostic and treatment pathways. Medical decision-making is based on a variety of interdependent factors related to different medical disciplines, past experience and clinical guidelines. Taking into account all decision factors in combination with the possible therapeutic approaches is a major challenge for physicians and often cannot be solved optimally even in an interdisciplinary tumor board. In this project, we are developing ATLAS, a decision support tool that will significantly assist clinicians in meeting this challenge. Based on AI methods, ATLAS processes all relevant patient data from databases, systems medicine and continuum biomechanical in silico prognosis models as well as individual patient data. The tool is being developed in a co-design approach by experts in surgical oncology, mathematical modeling and machine learning. The selected technologies will integrate automated understanding of a highly complex patient situation through simulation of liver functions with expert knowledge and ontology-driven learning with knowledge graphs from retrospective liver tumor cases. ATLAS will be based on a detailed historical data cohort of more than 6,000 patients with liver tumors and will be evaluated on case studies at the University Hospital of Jena. The integration of medical expert knowledge, mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence represents a highly original and promising approach for high-quality diagnosis and treatment of liver tumors, resulting in patient-specific improvement of prognosis. The scientific knowledge gained from these projects will provide opportunities for transfer to malignancies in other organs, such as the lung, kidney or brain. The development of tools and demonstrators will provide sustainable exploitation pathways for future commercial applications.'
