  abstract: 'This study explores the critical interplay between lobular geometry and the zonated distribution of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes across species. We present an innovative approach to assess lobular geometry and zonation patterns using whole slide imaging (WSI). This method allows a detailed, systematic comparison of lobular structures and spatial distribution of key CYP450 enzymes and glutamine synthetase in four different species (mouse, rat, pig, and human). Our results shed light on species differences in lobular geometry and enzymatic zonation, providing critical insights for drug metabolism research. Based on our approach we could determine the minimum number of lobules required for a statistically representative analysis, an important piece of information when evaluating liver biopsies and deriving information from WSI.'

  abstract: "We are pleased to announce that Shubhankar Palwankar has successfully defended his Master Thesis, which focuses on the development of a Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of enalapril, a key medication used to treat high blood pressure and other cardiovascular conditions.

Enalapril works as an ACE inhibitor, playing a crucial role in regulating blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Shubhankar's research involved the creation of an extensive database from 49 clinical trials, which was used to parameterize and validate his computational model. His model effectively simulates the pharmacokinetics of enalapril and its active metabolite, enalaprilat, under various conditions including renal and hepatic impairment and changes in CES1 enzyme activity.

The findings from this study offer valuable insights into how different physiological impairments affect the drug's behavior in the body, showing excellent agreement with clinical data. The developed model and data are publicly accessible in SBML format under a CC-BY 4.0 license from the PK-DB pharmacokinetics database, contributing to open science and further research in pharmacokinetics.

Congratulations to Shubhankar Palwankar for his significant contributions to pharmacological research and his successful thesis defense."

  short: "We're excited to announce the preprint of our latest research, 'Simulation of zonation-function relationships in the liver using coupled multiscale models: Application to drug-induced liver injury.' This study introduces a multiscale digital twin of the liver, integrating models from cellular to lobular scales, and sheds light on how liver zonation patterns influence drug-induced liver injury."
  abstract: 'Multiscale modeling requires the coupling of models on different scales, often based on different mathematical approaches and developed by different research teams. This poses many challenges, such as defining interfaces for coupling, reproducible exchange of submodels, efficient simulation of the models, or reproducibility of results. Here, we present a multiscale digital twin of the liver that couples a partial differential equation (PDE)-based porous media approach for the hepatic lobule with cellular-scale ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based models. The models based on the theory of porous media describe transport, tissue mechanical properties, and deformations at the lobular scale, while the cellular models describe hepatic metabolism in terms of drug metabolism and damage in terms of necrosis. The resulting multiscale model of the liver was used to simulate perfusion-zonation-function relationships in the liver spanning scales from single cell to the lobulus. The model was applied to study the effects of (i) protein zonation patterns (metabolic zonation) and (ii) drug concentration dependence on spatially heterogeneous liver damage in the form of necrosis. Depending on the zonation pattern, different liver damage patterns could be reproduced, including periportal and pericentral necrosis as seen in drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Increasing the drug concentration led to an increase in the observed damage pattern. A key point for the success was the integration of domain-specific simulators based on standard exchange formats, i.e., libroadrunner for the high-performance simulation of ODE-based systems and FEBio for the simulation of the continuum-biomechanical part. This allows a standardized and reproducible exchange of cellular scale models in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) between research groups.'

  abstract: "Essential prerequisites for the practical application and translation of computational models include: i) reproducibility of results; ii) model reusability and extensibility; iii) data availability; and iv) strategies for model stratification and individualization. Here, we present a modeling workflow built around these foundational prerequisites, with a focus on liver function tests.<br /><br />
  
Despite the paramount significance of liver function assessment in hepatology, reliable quantification remains a clinical challenge. Dynamic liver function tests offer a promising method for non-invasive in vivo assessment of liver function and metabolic phenotyping.<br /><br />
 
By leveraging whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, we're simulating these tests and positioning PBPK models as digital twins for metabolic phenotyping and liver function assessment. To develop and validate our models, we established the open pharmacokinetics database, PK-DB, containing curated data from 600+ clinical studies. Our models are individualizable and stratifiable, enabling simulation of lifestyle factors and co-administration effects on drug metabolism. Our models have been instrumental in clinical scenarios: from predicting individual outcomes post-hepatectomy to discerning the impact of CYP2D6 gene variants on liver function tests. These models are constructed hierarchically, describing metabolic and other biological processes in organs like the liver and kidneys, seamlessly integrated with whole-body physiology.<br /><br />

Notably, all models and data are readily available and reproducible for reuse, encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). We will provide an overview of these PBPK models and demonstrate how SBML and FAIR principles can facilitate model development, coupling, and reuse."

  short: 'Our latest publication is now on Frontiers of Endocrinology: A pathway model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the pancreatic Î²-cell'
  abstract: 'The pancreas plays a critical role in maintaining glucose homeostasis through the secretion of hormones from the islets of Langerhans. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by the pancreatic Î²-cell is the main mechanism for reducing elevated plasma glucose. Here we present a systematic modeling workflow for the development of kinetic pathway models using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). Steps include retrieval of information from databases, curation of experimental and clinical data for model calibration and validation, integration of heterogeneous data including absolute and relative measurements, unit normalization, data normalization, and model annotation. An important factor was the reproducibility and exchangeability of the model, which allowed the use of various existing tools. The workflow was applied to construct a novel data-driven kinetic model of GSIS in the pancreatic Î²-cell based on experimental and clinical data from 39 studies spanning 50 years of pancreatic, islet, and Î²-cell research in humans, rats, mice, and cell lines. The model consists of detailed glycolysis and phenomenological equations for insulin secretion coupled to cellular energy state, ATP dynamics and (ATP/ADP ratio). Key findings of our work are that in GSIS there is a glucose-dependent increase in almost all intermediates of glycolysis. This increase in glycolytic metabolites is accompanied by an increase in energy metabolites, especially ATP and NADH. One of the few decreasing metabolites is ADP, which, in combination with the increase in ATP, results in a large increase in ATP/ADP ratios in the Î²-cell with increasing glucose. Insulin secretion is dependent on ATP/ADP, resulting in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The observed glucose-dependent increase in glycolytic intermediates and the resulting change in ATP/ADP ratios and insulin secretion is a robust phenomenon observed across data sets, experimental systems and species. Model predictions of the glucose-dependent response of glycolytic intermediates and biphasic insulin secretion are in good agreement with experimental measurements. Our model predicts that factors affecting ATP consumption, ATP formation, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and ATP/ADP-dependent insulin secretion have a major effect on GSIS. In conclusion, we have developed and applied a systematic modeling workflow for pathway models that allowed us to gain insight into key mechanisms in GSIS in the pancreatic Î²-cell.'

  abstract: "Congratulations to Bea for successfully submitting her Bachelor thesis on a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of the probe drug talinolol for the characterization of intestinal P-glycoprotein.
    Talinolol, a cardioselective beta-blocker applied in treating various cardiovascular diseases and tachyarrhythmias, is widely adopted as a probe drug for the intestinal efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. In the human body, P-gp plays a crucial role, given its distribution across various tissues to protect against potentially toxic substances, while expediting the elimination of xenobiotics. By employing talinolol for P-gp phenotyping, researchers can evaluate factors that influence P-gp-mediated transport, such as P-gp genetic polymorphisms and its distribution throughout the intestine.

    Bea's thesis presents a comprehensive dataset on talinolol pharmacokinetics, the study of how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes drugs. This data was used to develop a PBPK model for talinolol, offering detailed insights into its behaviour within the body.

    The new model investigates the impact of numerous factors on talinolol's pharmacokinetics, including the genetic variants of P-gp, enzymatic activity of transporters OATP2B1 and OATP1B1, and site-specific distribution of P-gp and OATP2B1 proteins in the intestine. It also investigates the impact of diseases like liver cirrhosis and renal dysfunction."

In this study, we present a modeling workflow tailored to these critical aspects, with a focus on liver function tests.
Evaluating liver function is a crucial task in hepatology, yet accurately quantifying hepatic function has persisted as a clinical challenge. Dynamic liver function tests offer a promising method for non-invasive in vivo assessment of liver function and metabolic phenotyping. These clinical tests determine liver function through the elimination of a specific test substance, thus revealing information about the liver's metabolic capacity.
We employed whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to simulate these tests, which encompass absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination processes. PBPK models serve as powerful instruments for investigating drug metabolism and its impact on the human body. In this research, we showcase our efforts in utilizing PBPK models as digital twins for metabolic phenotyping and liver function evaluation. To develop and validate our models, we created the first open pharmacokinetics database, PK-DB, containing curated data from over 600 clinical studies. Our models are individualizable and stratifiable, enabling simulation of lifestyle factors and co-administration effects on drug metabolism.
We have applied our models to various clinical inquiries, such as simulating individual outcomes post-hepatectomy using an indocyanine green model and examining the influence of CYP2D6 gene variants through a dextromethorphan model integrated with drug-gene interactions. These models are constructed hierarchically, describing metabolic and other biological processes in organs like the liver and kidneys, connected to whole-body physiology. All models and data are accessible for reuse in a reproducible manner, encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).
In this study, we provide an overview of PBPK models and demonstrate how SBML, COMBINE standards, and FAIR principles can facilitate model development, coupling, and reuse."

  abstract: 'Across disciplines, researchers increasingly recognize that open science and reproducible research practices may accelerate scientific progress by allowing others to reuse research outputs and by promoting rigorous research that is more likely to yield trustworthy results. While initiatives, training programs, and funder policies encourage researchers to adopt reproducible research and open science practices, these practices are uncommon in many fields. Researchers need training to integrate these practices into their daily work. We organized a virtual brainstorming event, in collaboration with the German Reproducibility Network, to discuss strategies for making reproducible research and open science training the norm at research institutions. Here, we outline eleven strategies, concentrated in three areas: (1) offering training, (2) adapting research assessment criteria and program requirements, and (3) building communities. We provide a brief overview of each strategy, offer tips for implementation, and provide links to resources. Our goal is to encourage members of the research community to think creatively about the many ways they can contribute and collaborate to build communities, and make reproducible research and open science training the norm. Researchers may act in their roles as scientists, supervisors, mentors, instructors, and members of curriculum, hiring or evaluation committees. Institutional leadership and research administration and support staff can accelerate progress by implementing change across their institutions.'

This model takes into account various factors that can influence the activity of CYP enzymes, such as genetics, diet, age, environmental factors, and disease, making it a highly effective and reliable tool for assessing the in vivo activity of the CYP2E1 enzyme.
  
  What is  truly exciting about this research is that it incorporates the effect of ethanol consumption and liver impairment on the results of metabolic phenotyping with chlorzoxazone. This means that the model is not only accurate but also highly practical, as it takes into account factors that are commonly encountered in clinical practice.
  
  The extensive pharmacokinetic dataset for chlorzoxazone and the validated PBPK model are expected to have a significant impact on the field of pharmacokinetics, as they provide a reliable and comprehensive tool for assessing the activity of CYP2E1 in a wide range of clinical contexts. This research represents a major step forward in our understanding of the factors that influence the activity of CYP enzymes and promises to have a significant impact on the development of new drugs and the optimization of existing ones.'

The model consists of detailed glycolysis and equations for insulin secretion coupled to cellular energy state (ATP/ADP ratio). Key findings of our work are that in GSIS there is a glucose-dependent increase in almost all intermediates of glycolysis. This increase in glycolytic metabolites is accompanied by an increase in energy metabolites, especially ATP and NADH. One of the few decreasing metabolites is ADP, which, in combination with the increase in ATP, results in a large increase in ATP/ADP ratios in the beta-cell with increasing glucose. Insulin secretion is dependent on ATP/ADP, resulting in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The observed glucose-dependent increase in glycolytic intermediates and the resulting change in ATP/ADP ratios and insulin secretion is a robust phenomenon observed across data sets, experimental systems and species.'

  abstract: '<p>
  Within this project, a high quality database of sorafenib pharmacokinetic data used in systemic therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma will be established. Based on the pharmacokinetic data set, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model will be established for the evaluation of systemic sorafenib therapy in liver cancer. The model will be used to address important clinically relevant questions such as (1) sorafenib is contraindicated in advanced liver cirrhosis, (2) genetic variants of OATP uptake transporters may alter the efficacy of sorafenib, (3) CYP3A4 substrates lead to drug-drug interactions with sorafenib.

  Using established data curation pipelines, this project will extend our pharmacokinetics database PK-DB with literature data on Gd-EOB-DTPA. Based on the pharmacokinetic data set, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model will be established for the evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of Gd-EOB-DTPA and its use as an MRI contrast agent. The model will be used to address important clinically relevant questions such as (1) the effect of renal and hepatic impairment on Gd-EOB-DTPA pharmacokinetics, (2) the effect of perfusion and OATP on Gd-EOB-DTPA pharmacokinetics, (3) the relationship between concentration and MRI attenuation.

  abstract: '<p>
  Understanding a drugs pharmacokinetics - how it is absorbed, distributed, metabolised and excreted by the body - and its pharmacodynamics - how it affects the body - is a key challenge in treating people. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics are two classes of drugs used to treat high blood pressure. Both are among the most commonly prescribed drugs due to the high prevalence of hypertension in an ageing society. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In this X-student research group we will develop physiologically based pharmacokinetic models of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide and the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. The methodological approach is a combination of lectures, tutorials and practical work by the students. The research project is aimed at students with a STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) background, including biology, computer science and medical students. Basic programming skills in Python are required.

  short: 'Our latest preprint is now on medRxiv: Simvastatin therapy in different subtypes of hypercholesterolemia - a physiologically based modelling approach.'
  abstract: 'Hypercholesterolemia is a multifaceted plasma lipid disorder with heterogeneous causes including lifestyle and genetic factors. A key feature of hypercholesterolemia is elevated plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Several genetic variants have been reported to be associated with hypercholesterolemia, known as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Important variants affect the LDL receptor (LDLR), which mediates the uptake of LDL-C from the plasma, apoliporotein B (APOB), which is involved in the binding of LDL-C to the LDLR, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which modulates the degradation of the LDLR. A typical treatment for hypercholesterolemia is statin medication, with simvastatin being one of the most commonly prescribed statins. In this work, the LDL-C lowering therapy with simvastatin in hypercholesterolemia was investigated using a computational modeling approach. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of simvastatin integrated with a pharmacodynamic model of plasma LDL-C (PBPK/PD) was developed based on extensive data curation. A key component of the model is LDL-C turnover by the liver, consisting of: hepatic cholesterol synthesis with the key enzymes HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase; cholesterol export from the liver as VLDL-C; de novo synthesis of LDLR; transport of LDLR to the membrane; binding of LDL-C by LDLR via APOB; endocytosis of the LDLR-LDL-C complex; recycling of LDLR from the complex. The model was applied to study the effects of simvastatin therapy in hypercholesterolemia due to different causes in the LDLR pathway corresponding to different subtypes of hypercholesterolemia. Model predictions of LDL-C lowering therapy were validated with independent clinical data sets. Key findings are: (i) hepatic LDLR turnover is highly heterogeneous among FH classes; (ii) despite this heterogeneity, simvastatin therapy results in a consistent reduction in plasma LDL-C regardless of class; and (iii) simvastatin therapy shows a dose-dependent reduction in LDL-C. Our model suggests that the underlying cause of hypercholesterolemia does not influence simvastatin therapy. Furthermore, our model supports the treatment strategy of stepwise dose adjustment to achieve target LDL-C levels. Both the model and the database are freely available for reuse.'

  abstract: 'Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death. Diagnosis and treatment are time-critical and require highly patient-specific diagnostic and treatment pathways. Medical decision-making is based on a variety of interdependent factors related to different medical disciplines, past experience and clinical guidelines. Taking into account all decision factors in combination with the possible therapeutic approaches is a major challenge for physicians and often cannot be solved optimally even in an interdisciplinary tumor board. In this project, we are developing ATLAS, a decision support tool that will significantly assist clinicians in meeting this challenge. Based on AI methods, ATLAS processes all relevant patient data from databases, systems medicine and continuum biomechanical in silico prognosis models as well as individual patient data. The tool is being developed in a co-design approach by experts in surgical oncology, mathematical modeling and machine learning. The selected technologies will integrate automated understanding of a highly complex patient situation through simulation of liver functions with expert knowledge and ontology-driven learning with knowledge graphs from retrospective liver tumor cases. ATLAS will be based on a detailed historical data cohort of more than 6,000 patients with liver tumors and will be evaluated on case studies at the University Hospital of Jena. The integration of medical expert knowledge, mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence represents a highly original and promising approach for high-quality diagnosis and treatment of liver tumors, resulting in patient-specific improvement of prognosis. The scientific knowledge gained from these projects will provide opportunities for transfer to malignancies in other organs, such as the lung, kidney or brain. The development of tools and demonstrators will provide sustainable exploitation pathways for future commercial applications.'
