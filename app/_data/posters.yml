  abstract: 'Background and Aims: Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Despite the various therapeutic options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment, selecting patient-specific therapy remains challenging. A major challenge is predicting the distribution and heterogeneity of anti-cancer medication in the liver due to factors such as liver anatomy, vascular topology, perfusion and tumour location. In this study, we applied a recently published algorithm [1] to generate vessel trees within a defined liver volume and modelled the spatio-temporal pharmacokinetics of the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib (NEXAVAR®) within the liver. Our objectives were: (i) to generate physiologically realistic arterial, portal, venous, and biliary vessel trees in a given liver volume; (ii) to develop a mechanistic pharmacokinetic model for substance transport in these trees; (iii) to couple this model with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of sorafenib; and (iv) to simulate drug concentration dynamics within the liver.
  Methods: Substance transport along the vessel and biliary trees was modelled using ordinary differential equations. Each terminal segment of the trees was associated with a terminal liver volume, representing the hepatic tissue supplied by individual terminal arterial, portal, venous, and biliary segments. In each terminal volume, the local sorafenib metabolism and biliary excretion were modelled. Model performance was evaluated using published pharmacokinetic data.
  Results: The algorithm successfully generated physiologically realistic, non-intersecting arterial, portal, venous, and biliary trees within the liver volume. The surrogate mechanistic–PBPK model reproduced published pharmacokinetic data for sorafenib and enabled spatially resolved predictions of drug concentrations along the vascular and biliary trees and within liver tissue. 
  Simulations revealed that the time to reach maximum sorafenib concentration in liver tissue was directly related to proximity to the start of inflow trees and inversely to proximity to the end of outflow trees. These results underscore the influence of the liver anatomy, its vascularisation topology and target location on intrahepatic drug exposure, suggesting that individualised dosing strategies could enhance therapeutic response in HCC.
  Conclusion: The established workflow for simulating the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of anti-cancer medication in a given liver anatomy can provide important information for individual HCC treatment planning.

  abstract: "Introduction: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as captopril, are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Captopril, the first ACE inhibitor developed in the 1980s, is primarily taken orally and is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations within an hour. Its half-life is approximately 2 hours, but several factors, including renal function, heart disease, age and sex, can affect its pharmacokinetics. Despite the widespread use of captopril, comprehensive pharmacokinetic data have been lacking. Our group has developed PK-DB (https://pk-db.com) [1], an open database containing high-quality pharmacokinetic data from clinical and preclinical research. PK-DB includes patient cohort characteristics, interventions, concentration-time profiles, and kinetic parameters, with the ability to automatically calculate pharmacokinetic parameters using non-compartmental methods. 
  
  Objectives: The objectives of this study were to curate and analyze captopril pharmacokinetic data, expand the PK-DB, develop a whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) model of captopril in accordance with FAIR principles [2], and improve understanding of the intra-individual variability in captopril pharmacokinetics influenced by factors such as age, sex, renal and cardiac function. 
  
  Methods: Over 600 publications on captopril pharmacokinetics were reviewed through a systematic literature search, with a subset selected for data curation in PK-DB. The PBPK model was developed using a compartmental approach and encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) [3] for accessibility and reproducibility. 
  
  Results: A comprehensive set of captopril pharmacokinetic data was generated from 15 clinical studies in healthy volunteers and patients with renal impairment, heart failure and hypertension. The PBPK model includes four major compartments (blood, intestine, liver, kidney) and describes absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. It successfully represents the pharmacokinetic profile of captopril in different age groups, showing minimal age-related differences in unchanged drug concentration. Heart failure did not significantly affect maximum plasma concentration or area under the curve (AUC), but renal function strongly influenced captopril elimination. We present this data set and open PBPK model of captopril as a valuable resource for further research. 
  
  Conclusions: This study successfully establishes a freely accessible, comprehensive dataset and an open PBPK model of captopril, enhancing our understanding of its pharmacokinetic behavior across different patient groups. Our findings emphasize the significance of renal function in captopril elimination and provide a valuable resource for personalized medicine approaches in hypertension and heart failure treatment.

  abstract: "Introduction: Plasma glucose levels are tightly controlled to ensure a constant glucose supply and to avoid toxic effects of hyperglycemic conditions. The liver is the central organ of glucose homeostasis and the main glucose producer (hepatic glucose production HGP), but also utilizes glucose for biosyntheses and storage in fatty acids (hepatic glucose utilization HGU).
  Results: We present the first detailed kinetic model of the human hepatocyte glucose metabolism [Fig.1] which comprises allosteric regulation as well as hormonal regulation by insulin and glucagon via inter-convertible enzymes [Fig.2]. The model reproduces fundamental features of hepatic glucose metabolism like glucose dependent switch between HGP and HGU [Fig.3] observed changes in glucose homeostasis in diabetes II [Fig.4] dependency of HGP on gluconeogenic substrates (lactate).
  Outlook: Possible future applications of the model are analysis of hepatic effects of various diabetic treatments simulations of the influence of temporary changes in the gene expression on the glucose homeostasis (for example circadian rhythms of gene expression)."
