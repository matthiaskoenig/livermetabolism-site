  abstract: "Essential prerequisites for the practical application and translation of computational models include: i) reproducibility of results; ii) model reusability and extensibility; iii) data availability; and iv) strategies for model stratification and individualization. Here, we present a modeling workflow built around these foundational prerequisites, with a focus on liver function tests.
  Despite the paramount significance of liver function assessment in hepatology, reliable quantification remains a clinical challenge. Dynamic liver function tests offer a promising method for non-invasive in vivo assessment of liver function and metabolic phenotyping. 
  By leveraging whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, we're simulating these tests and positioning PBPK models as digital twins for metabolic phenotyping and liver function assessment. To develop and validate our models, we established the open pharmacokinetics database, PK-DB, containing curated data from 600+ clinical studies [10.1093/nar/gkaa990, 10.3389/fphar.2021.752826]. Our models are individualizable and stratifiable, enabling simulation of lifestyle factors and co-administration effects on drug metabolism. Our models have been instrumental in clinical scenarios: from predicting individual outcomes post-hepatectomy [10.3389/fphys.2021.730418, 10.3389/fphys.2021.757293] to discerning the impact of CYP2D6 gene variants on liver function tests [10.3389/fphar.2022.1029073]. These models are constructed hierarchically, describing metabolic and other biological processes in organs like the liver and kidneys, seamlessly integrated with whole-body physiology. 
  Notably, all models and data are readily available and reproducible for reuse, encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) [10.15252/msb.20199110]. We will provide an overview of these PBPK models and demonstrate how SBML and FAIR principles can facilitate model development, coupling, and reuse."

  abstract: "Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are powerful tools for studying drug metabolism and its effect on the human body. Here, we present our work on PBPK models for metabolic phenotyping and liver function evaluation [1-5]. To develop and validate our models, we established the first open pharmacokinetics database, PK-DB, which contains curated data from over 600 clinical studies. Our models can be individualized and stratified, allowing us to simulate the effect of lifestyle factors and co-administration on drug metabolism.
   We have applied our models to various clinical questions, such as simulating individual outcomes after hepatectomy using an indocyanine green model and studying the effect of CYP2D6 gene variants using a model of dextromethorphan coupled with drug-gene interactions. These models are constructed hierarchically, describing metabolism and other biological processes of organs such as liver and kidney coupled to whole-body physiology. All models and data are available for reuse in a reproducible manner encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).
   One of the major challenges in PBPK modeling is the integration of these models with cellular and continuum-biomechanical models. By coupling PBPK models with these models, it becomes possible to provide drug concentrations at the site of action as boundary conditions and time-varying inputs to continuum-biomechanical models. This approach enables us to study the impact of systemic chemotherapy on tumor growth or to investigate changes in perfusion and pressure at the whole-body level on transport and biomechanical properties at the tissue scale.
   To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we present an example of PBPK modeling coupled with a multiscale and multiphase continuum-biomechanical model for the liver. Our model integrates partial differential equations (PDE) on the lobular scale with ordinary differential equations (ODE) on the cellular and whole-body scale, resulting in a PDE-ODE coupling. In our showcase, we investigate the drug metabolization process in the liver, considering the possible damage to the liver tissue due to necrosis caused by a toxic side product. The substrates and products of this process can be transported via the systemic circulation and be removed by the kidneys. By coupling PBPK models with continuum-biomechanical models, we can study the transport and biomechanical properties of these substances at both the tissue and whole-body levels. This coupling approach provides a promising method for studying drug metabolism and its effect on the human body at multiple scales, ranging from cellular to whole-body.
   Our approach allows us to investigate the impact of this drug metabolization process on the liver tissue and how it affects the overall functioning of the body. Additionally, we can study the impact of various factors, such as different drug dosages, on this process and determine the optimal drug dosage for a given patient. This integrated approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the drug metabolization process and its impact on the human body, paving the way for more effective drug development and personalized medicine.

In this study, we present a modeling workflow tailored to these critical aspects, with a focus on liver function tests.
Evaluating liver function is a crucial task in hepatology, yet accurately quantifying hepatic function has persisted as a clinical challenge. Dynamic liver function tests offer a promising method for non-invasive in vivo assessment of liver function and metabolic phenotyping. These clinical tests determine liver function through the elimination of a specific test substance, thus revealing information about the liver's metabolic capacity.
We employed whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to simulate these tests, which encompass absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination processes. PBPK models serve as powerful instruments for investigating drug metabolism and its impact on the human body. In this research, we showcase our efforts in utilizing PBPK models as digital twins for metabolic phenotyping and liver function evaluation [1-6]. To develop and validate our models, we created the first open pharmacokinetics database, PK-DB, containing curated data from over 600 clinical studies. Our models are individualizable and stratifiable, enabling simulation of lifestyle factors and co-administration effects on drug metabolism.

All models and data are accessible for reuse in a reproducible manner, encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).
In this study, we provide an overview of PBPK models and demonstrate how SBML [7-8], COMBINE standards [9], and FAIR principles [10] can facilitate model development, coupling, and reuse.
