    <p>Welcome to our teaching page! Our focus is on project-based learning that empowers students to actively engage with real-world challenges in digital health and shared decision-making. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, innovative digital formats, and a strong commitment to Open Science and ethical research, we create hands-on, inclusive learning environments. By supporting early-career researchers—especially women—and integrating digital competencies, we prepare the next generation of professionals to shape the future of healthcare.</p>
